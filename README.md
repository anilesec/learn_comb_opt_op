## learn_comb_opt_op
This repository contains the code for solving combinatorial optimization problem using learning based methods. Combinatorial optimization problem considered in this case is Orienteering Problem which is a member of routing problems.

## Network1:
Computes the node embeddings based on the supervised solution set for the OP problem
For now, it is simple GCN network as it is in the T.Kipf [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02907.pdf)
